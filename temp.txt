SYNOPSIS:

  Displays the contents of the file(s) specified.

USAGE:

  cat.exe [options] file [file...n]

  file      The name of the file to display. Enclose file names within quotes 
            if it includes a space.

  -p        Pauses after each screenful (applies -pp).
  -pp       Pauses at the end.

  -l        Include line numbers in the output.
  -w        Nicely wrap lines longer than window width.

  -ib       Ignore blank lines.
  -ibw      Ignore blank and whitespace lines.
  -il:xyz   Ignore lines starting with 'xyz'.

  -f        Forces plain text display (ignores plugins).

  * You can reverse the effect of a flag, by prefixing it with a bang (!). 
    This is useful when you need to override an environment variable.

PLUGINS:

  --show-plugins    Displays all plugins that are available.

  Plugins must be in the same directory as cat.exe and must match the file 
  pattern: `cat.*.dll`. See https://github.com/kodybrown/cat for more details.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

  --show-envars     Displays all environment variables.

  These values can be set in your environment so you don't have to type them 
  into the command-line every time you run `cat.exe`.

  To set a value, prefix the (short) command-line argument name with `cat`. 
  The values are the same as you would use for the command-line.

  Examples:

    > SET cat_l=true
    > SET cat_w=true
    > SET cat_ib=true
    > SET cat_ibw=true
    > SET cat_il=xyz
    > SET cat_f=true

  * Only the examples displayed are considered valid environment variables.
  * Arguments specified on the command-line will always override environment 
    variables.
  * Consult your operating system help for information on how to set 
    environment variables for all sessions.
